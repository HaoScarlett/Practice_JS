    We have to iterate over all the elements in the array. 
    Suppose that the original array contains N elements, 
    the time taken here would be O(N).
    Next, for every unwanted duplicate element, 
    we will have to perform a delete operation and deletions in arrays are also O(N).
    The worst case would be when all the elements in the array are the same. 
    In that case, we would be performing Nâˆ’2 deletions thus giving us O(N**2) complexity 
    for deletions.
    Overall complexity = O(N)+O(N**2)=O(N**2).
