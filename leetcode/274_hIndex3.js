// 274. H-Index Counting Algorithm
var hIndex = function (citations) {

  // Initialize the count arr
  let count = Array(n + 1).fill(0);

  // Step 1. Count the frequency of each citation
  // if we have a paper of 5 citations, we check if there're
  // at least 5 papers with 5 citations each.
  //   ðŸ§© Use for...of

    if (citation > n) {
      // If citation is greater than n, count it in the last index
      count[n]++;
    }
    count[citation]++;
  }

  // Step 2. Accumulate counts backward to find the h-index
  // We keep doing this, going down from the highest likes to lower ones,
  // until we find the biggest number where a researcher has at least that many papers,
  // and each paper has been liked or mentioned at least that many times.
